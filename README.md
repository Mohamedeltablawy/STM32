# Embedded AI Project with STM32 and ESP32 Camera

Welcome to the **Embedded AI Project**! This project leverages an STM32 microcontroller and an ESP32-based camera module to implement AI functionalities on embedded systems, such as image capture, processing, and basic analysis.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how an STM32 microcontroller can be paired with an ESP32 camera module to perform embedded AI tasks. We will use the STM32F103C8T6 board as the central processing unit and the ESP32 camera (with the OV2640 sensor) for image capture. The AI model will be optimized and deployed on the STM32, using data from the ESP32 camera.

## Features

- **Image Capture**: Real-time image capture using the ESP32 OV2640 camera.
- **Embedded AI**: Model deployment and processing on STM32F103C8T6.
- **Connectivity**: Communication between STM32 and ESP32 for data transfer.
- **Night Vision**: 850nm night vision capability with the OV2640.
- **Expandable Functionality**: Potential for additional sensors, such as accelerometers or microphones, if needed.
